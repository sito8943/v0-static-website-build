Create a responsive landing page (coffee shop theme) and output three separate files: index.html, styles.css, script.js.

Structure
	•	Semantic HTML only: header, main, section, footer.
	•	Header with site name/logo and simple nav.
	•	Hero section: heading, subheading, call-to-action button.
	•	After hero section, include:
	1.	Our Features – showcase coffee shop highlights (quality beans, cozy atmosphere, fresh pastries).
	2.	Who We Are – short description about the team/story.
	3.	Testimonials – quotes from happy customers.
	4.	Contact Section – simple contact form or contact details with a map placeholder.
	•	Footer with copyright and minimal links.

Styling
	•	Pure hand-written CSS only (no frameworks/libraries).
	•	Use CSS variables (:root) for colors, fonts, spacing.
	•	Light theme only — clean, airy, elegant.
	•	Fluid typography with clamp().
	•	Mobile-first media queries.
	•	Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout.
	•	Use logical properties (margin-inline, padding-block).
	•	Smooth hover/focus transitions.
	•	Minimal reset: * { box-sizing: border-box; margin:0; padding:0 }.
	•	Accessible focus outlines and sufficient contrast.
	•	Fonts: Poppins for headings, Roboto for body/links/buttons (via Google Fonts).

Design Direction
	•	Theme: coffee shop landing page, but light and elegant (not dark/coffee brown).
	•	Color palette: muted, warm, soft tones (light beige, cream, muted green).
	•	Style: minimalist, flat, friendly, inspirational.
	•	Spacing: airy with plenty of white space.
	•	Buttons/links: rounded soft edges.
	•	Imagery: abstract coffee-inspired shapes or subtle illustrations.
	•	Motion: smooth, subtle micro-interactions.
	•	Layout personality: asymmetrical but balanced.

JavaScript
	•	Vanilla JS only.
	•	Minimal behavior: toggle mobile nav menu (with ARIA labels).

Accessibility
	•	Proper alt text for images.
	•	Semantic markup.
	•	ARIA labels where needed.
	•	Sufficient color contrast.

Deliverable format
	•	Return three separate code blocks: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
	•	Well-commented, clean, production-ready.
